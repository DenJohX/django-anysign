`django-anysign`'s signature backend encapsulates signature workflow and
integration with vendor specific implementation.

.. note::

   The backend API is quite experimental. This document deals with both vision
   (concepts) and current implementation (which may improve).


******************
Scope of a backend
******************

A signature backend is typically known by models and views. They use the
backend to perform vendor-specific operations. The backend contains
vendor-specific implementation that has to be shared with several consumers
such as models and views.

A signature backend also typically knowns the workflows. So it should be
helpful for URL resolution.

Here is the current implementation of base backend.

   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :member-order: bysource

Here is the demo signature backend implementation provided by
:ref:`django-dummysign-section`.
